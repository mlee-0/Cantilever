## Cantilever
Run `main.py` to train the model.
* Set the number of epochs and learning rate manually.
* Model parameters are saved periodically as `model.pth`.
* Training can be continued if an existing `model.pth` exists. Confirm this when prompted by typing "y" or "n". To train from scratch, remove `model.pth` from the folder.
    * The model being trained must match the model stored in `model.pth`.
* After training, plots showing the loss history and evaluation metrics are displayed, and output images and their corresponding label images are saved.

### File Structure
* `samples_train.txt` and `samples_test.txt` contain the generated datasets. These files are generated by running `generate_train_dataset.py` and `generate_test_dataset.py`.
* `ansys_template.lgw` contains ANSYS APDL code used to automate FEA simulations for generating labels. It contains placeholder text that are replaced to create separate scripts, `ansys_script_train.lgw` and `ansys_script_test.lgw`, which are used for generating labels for the training and testing datasets.
* The folders `Train Outputs` and `Test Outputs` contain `.txt` files generated in ANSYS APDL. These files are used as labels during training. Output images generated by the model are saved in `Test Outputs`.

## Google Colab

### Uploading Files
1. Upload all required `.py` files other than `main.py` to the current directory: `/content/`. These files need to be uploaded each time the session resets.
2. Uploaded all other required files (`.txt`, etc.) to a folder of choice in Google Drive. This folder is specified in the code as: `drive/My Drive/<FOLDER>`. Click "Mount Drive" in the sidebar to make files from Google Drive available. This creates a folder called `drive` in the directory `/content/`.
