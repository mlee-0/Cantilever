# Cantilever
2D stress distribution prediction in cantilever beams using convolutional neural network.

Variable parameters:
* Beam length
* Beam height
* Load angle
* Load location

Input images:
* Channel 1: Beam shape and load location
* Channel 2: Load angle

Output images:
* 2D von Mises stress distributions generated by FEA simulations in ANSYS (Mechanical APDL)


## Training and Testing
Run `main.py` to train and test the model. Set the training hyperparameters and other settings manually. After training, model predictions can be shown.


### Ansys (Mechanical APDL)
To run the script in Ansys:
* File > Change Directory... > [Select the desired folder]
* File > Read Input from... > [Select the `.lgw` file]
* To maximize performance, close the folder in which the program is running.


## Google Colab

### Uploading Files
1. Upload all required `.py` files other than `main.py` to the current directory: `/content/`. These files need to be uploaded each time the session resets.
2. Uploaded all other required files (`.csv`, `.txt`, etc.) to a folder of choice in Google Drive. This folder is specified in the code as: `drive/My Drive/<FOLDER>`. Click "Mount Drive" in the sidebar to make files from Google Drive available. This creates a folder called `drive` in the directory `/content/`.
