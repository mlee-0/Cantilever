    """
    Find a subset within the given array in which the same number of maximum values exists in each bin, and write a text file containing index numbers for the subset. For a given dataset, the same samples will be included in the subset because the first n samples are selected from each histogram bin rather than being randomly selected. The order of the samples in the subset is randomized.

    `labels`: An array in which the first dimension is the sample dimension.
    `filename`: Name of file to which the subset is written.
    `subset_size`: The number of samples to put in the subset. The actual subset size may not exactly match this number.
    `bins`: The number of bins to use in the histogram of maximum values.
    `nonuniformity`: How much larger than the smallest bin the largest bin is. For example, a value of 1 results in a uniform distribution, in which the largest bin has as many samples as the smallest bin. A value of 2 results in the largest bin having twice as many samples as the smallest bin.
